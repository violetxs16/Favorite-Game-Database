# Favorite-Game-Database
The Favorite Game Database project is an interactive web application designed to let users store and manage their favorite games in a centralized database. Built using a combination of HTML and PHP, the project features a user-friendly form where individuals can input their first name, last name, age, and, most importantly, their favorite game. The PHP backend, equipped with validation mechanisms, securely processes the form submissions and stores the data in a MySQL database managed through phpMyAdmin.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Form: The HTML form provides a seamless experience, prompting users to input their personal details and, of course, their cherished favorite game.

Data Validation: PHP scripts diligently validate user inputs, ensuring that the information submitted is complete and accurate.

Database Integration: The project seamlessly connects to a MySQL database, allowing for the organized storage of user data.

Dynamic Functionality: Users can not only add new entries but also delete existing ones or update the information associated with a particular entry. This dynamic functionality enhances the versatility of the application, offering a comprehensive user experience.
